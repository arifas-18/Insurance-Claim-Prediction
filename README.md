# Insurance-Claim-Prediction
Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting whether a customer will file an insurance claim based on their policy and personal details. Accurate claim prediction helps insurance companies reduce financial risk, detect fraudulent claims, and improve premium pricing strategies.
## Models Used

The following machine learning models were implemented and evaluated:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree Classifier

Random Forest Classifier

Gradient Boosting Classifier
Model Evaluation Metrics

Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1-score
## Best Model Selection
Random Forest achieved the highest accuracy compared to other models. However, due to class imbalance, the model primarily predicts the majority class (No Claim), resulting in very low precision and recall for claim detection.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the challenges of predicting insurance claims using imbalanced data. While Random Forest achieved high accuracy, further improvements are needed to enhance claim detection performance. The project highlights the importance of selecting appropriate evaluation metrics for real-world machine learning problems.
